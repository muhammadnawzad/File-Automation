# File-Automation
A project to automate file organization in Linux using Python.
The project is built due to my laziness to move files into their specific directories. ;)

Works only on files not directories (I don't usually have them and when I do, I want to do it personally).

How it works:
  When you save/move/copy a file to one of the main directories(ex: Downloads, Documents...etc), it will automatically move it to its spesified directory. It will use both extention and the 2/3 letter code that I provide in the beginning of file name.

Used Language:
  Python.

Compatible System:
  Linux.

Used Modules:
  OS Module.
  Random Module.

Categories are provided in another file along with the extentions.
