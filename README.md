# File-Automation
A project to automate file organization in Linux using Python.
The project is built due to my laziness to move files into their specific directories. ;)

Works only on files not directories (I don't usually have them and when I do, I want to do it personally).

Used Language:
  Python.

Compatible System:
  Linux.

Used Modules:
  OS Module.
  Random Module.

Categories are provided in another file along with the extentions.
